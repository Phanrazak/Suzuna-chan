>Discord bot

This bot was made specifically for PhanCord. I never intended it to do much more.
But if you wanna use it. Just replace the values in "example.config.json" and rename the file to "config.json". And replace the values in pulltweet because it's hardcoded.

This bot uses Discord.js, node.js, twit package for npm and vndb package for npm.


to install all of the packages. Do these separately  
```
npm i discord.js
npm i node.js
npm i twit
npm i vndb
```
Despite all the features. I would not call this a 1.0 even. Probably like Beta
